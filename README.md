# Employee_burnout_prediction
## About the Project
This project aims to predict the probability of employee burnout based on various features such as gender, company type, designation, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, and WFH (Work From Home) setup. By leveraging data science techniques, the goal is to understand the factors contributing to burnout and help organizations take preventive measures.

The model is built using Linear Regression, with the performance evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score. Correlation analysis has been conducted to identify the relationships between features and the target variable.
